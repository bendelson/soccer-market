    <h1><strong>The global soccer inflation</strong></h1>
    <p class="subtitle"><i>An analysis on the market for male soccer players in the last twenty years. <b>By Ben Mendelson</b></i></p>
    <p>Here comes an anecdote about the soccer world and how it has changed with big money coming in.</p>
    <p>Do you still remember <b>Thierry Henry</b>?</p>
    <img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/vjcfMrLLJ2xCE/giphy.gif" 
     alt="Henry GIF" 
     style="display: block; margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />


    <p>The French national was a striker for Arsenal London and pretty succesful.
    Back in his prime, twenty years ago, Henry was worth <b>45 million euros</b>.</p>
    <p>That meant: He was <b>the most valuable player</b> in the English Premier League.
    <i>Each bag of money in this picture represents five million euros.</i></p>
    <img class="centered-image" src="Container 16_9 (1920x1080px)-24.jpg" alt="henry was worth 45 million euros" />

    <p>Now let me introduce you to a Norwegian with long blond hair.
    <b>Erling Haaland</b> is the current Premier League player with the highest market value.
    Since 2022, he plays for Manchester City.</p>
    <p>Bayern Munich once tried to hire him, but they joked about having to send him to a hairdresser first.</p>

     alt="Haaland GIF" 
     style="display: block; margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
    <p>Oh, by the way, his market value is estimated at <b>180 million euros</b>.</p>
    <img class="centered-image" src="Container 16_9 (1920x1080px)-25.jpg" alt="haaland is worth 180 million euros" />

    <p>So that would mean, he is now worth four Henrys.</p>
    <p>Before taxes and inflation, of course.</p>
    <img class="centered-image" src="Container 16_9 (1920x1080px)-26.jpg" alt="haaland is worth four henrys" />


    
    <p>Haaland's team mates from Manchester City on average are worth 38.2 million euros today.</p>
    <p>Twenty years ago, the average player of ManCity was worth 2.8 million euros.</p>
    <p>So today, the players are worth fourteen times the amount from twenty years ago.</p>
    <p>Arguably, players today probably aren't fourteen times as good as they were twenty years ago. The increase rather has to do with the involvement of big investors and the growth of soccer economy overall.</p>
    <h2>The soccer inflation</h2>
    <p>And the increase in player's values is not alone an english phenomenon, as the following graph shows.</p>
    <p>It's what happened in all the big european soccer leagues since 2004: in Italy, France, Spain and Germany.</p>
    <div class="first-chart-container">
      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/24557878"></div>
    </div>
    <p>This is now showing the relative development. So for every league, the average price of a player is set to the index value of 100%.</p>
    <p>Also, the graph shows the inflation, to show the relationship between soccer economics and the real world.</p>
