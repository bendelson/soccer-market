    <h1><strong>The global soccer inflation</strong></h1>
    <p class="subtitle">An analysis on the market for male soccer players in the last twenty years. <br><i>By Ben Mendelson</i></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 32em;">Quick question: Do you also hate it, when people talk too positively about how things were "back in the days" and how they don't understand, 
      why things changed the way they did? </p>
    <p>Sorry to say, but this story is going to add to that narrative.<br><br>
    Another question: Do you still remember <b>Thierry Henry</b>?</p>
    <img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/vjcfMrLLJ2xCE/giphy.gif" 
     alt="Henry GIF" 
     style="display: block; margin: 2em auto; width: 400px; height: auto;" />


    <p>The French national was a striker for Arsenal London and pretty succesful.<br>
    Back in his prime, twenty years ago, Henry was worth <b>45 million euros</b>.</p>
    <p>That meant: He was <b>the most valuable player</b> in the English Premier League.<br>
    <i>Each bag of money in this picture represents five million euros.</i></p>
    <img class="centered-image" src="Container 16_9 (1920x1080px)-24.jpg" alt="henry was worth 45 million euros" />

    <p style="margin-bottom: 5em;">Now let me introduce you to a Norwegian with blond hair:
    <b>Erling Haaland</b>.<br> He is 25 years old and the current Premier League player with the highest market value.<br>
    Since 2022, he plays for Manchester City.</p>
    <p>Bayern Munich once tried to hire him, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8Wxja59XEc8" target="_blank"><i>but they joked about having to send him to a hairdresser first</i></a>.</p>
    <img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZDEwengzNjYyeGpyNHVreTRycmNzMnkzaTMyaTkwbWZoOG9iZ2J4ZiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/H9tRvFsIRuQ7PBI5c3/giphy.gif" 
     alt="Haaland GIF" 
     style="display: block; margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
    <p>Oh, by the way, his market value is now estimated at <b>180 million euros</b> <i>or 36 of our 5-million-bags</i>.</p>
    <img class="centered-image" src="Container 16_9 (1920x1080px)-25.jpg" alt="haaland is worth 180 million euros" />

    <p>So that would mean, he is now worth four Henrys.<br><br>
    Before taxes and inflation, of course.</p>
    <img class="centered-image" src="Container 16_9 (1920x1080px)-26.jpg" alt="haaland is worth four henrys" />


    
    <p>Haaland's team mates from Manchester City on average are worth <b>38.2 million euros</b> today.<br>
    Twenty years ago, the average player of ManCity was worth <b>2.8 million euros</b>.<br><br>
    So today, the players are worth fourteen times the amount from twenty years ago.</p>
    <p>Arguably, players today <i>probably aren't fourteen times as good</i> as they were twenty years ago. <br><br>The increase rather has to do with the involvement of big investors and the growth of the soccer economy bubble overall.</p>
    <p>And this increase in player's values is not a singular English phenomenon, as the following graph shows.<br>
    It's what happened in all the big european soccer leagues since 2004: in Italy, France, Spain and Germany.</p>
    <div class="first-chart-container" style="max-width: 50vw;">

    </div>
    <h2>The soccer inflation</h2>
    <p>Prices for soccer players increased. So far, so normal. A liter of milk also costs more today than it did in 1974.</p>
    <p>But when you put the price increase of a soccer league in comparison to the overall inflation of that country, it shows how the soccer market has dettached from the rest of the economy.<br><br>
      The following graphs show this development for England and Germany and their major and second league. The average price level of 2004 is set to 100%.</p>
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart grid-item" data-src="visualisation/24537499"></div>
      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart grid-item" data-src="visualisation/24537536"></div>
      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart grid-item" data-src="visualisation/24531990"></div>
      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart grid-item" data-src="visualisation/24537456"></div>
    </div>

    <p>And you can see comparable developments in the American Major Soccer League, the Saudi-Arabien SPL and in Italy and Spain. <br><br>
    Players are now worth three to almost seven times the amount compared to some years ago. <br><br>Inflation didn't even double in the same time.</p>
